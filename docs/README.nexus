[size=3][u][b]Features[/b][/u][/size]
[list]
[*] Assign any appropriate Player-owned ship to commander with [b]Repeat Orders[/b] enabled as subordinate with [b]Mimic[/b] behavior.
[*] The subordinate ship will copy the [b]Repeat Orders[/b] of its commander.
[*] Ships with insufficient AI Pilot skill to use [b]Repeat Orders[/b] will be not assigned or removed.
[*] Any changes to the commander's [b]Repeat Orders[/b] will be automatically reflected on the subordinate ship.
[*] Works with [b]Sell[/b], [b]Buy[/b], [b]MiningPlayer[/b] and [b]CollectDrops[/b] vanilla orders.
[*] Works with [b]MiningPlayerSector[/b] order from the [b]Mining in Sector for Mimic Repeat Orders[/b] mod.
[/list]
